Note that this compiles the underlying c code, which might take 10-20 minutes or so

  gem install decc_2050_model
  
UPDATING TO NEWER VERSIONS OF EXCEL MODEL

First of all, you need to be working on the github version of the code, not the rubygem:
    
	git clone http://github.com/decc/decc_2050_model

Then put the new spreadsheet in spreadsheet/2050Model.xlsx

Then, from the top directory of the gem:
  
  bundle
  rm ext/decc_2050_model.c
  bundle exec rake
  
The next step is to check whether lib/decc_2050_model/decc_2050_model_result.rb and lib/decc_2050_model/model_structure.rb need to be altered so that they
pick up the correct places in the underlying excel.
  
The final stage is to build and install the new gem:
    
	gem build decc_2050_model.gemspec
	gem install decc_2050_model-<version>.gem 

... where <version> is the version number of the gem file that was created in the folder.
